\arguments{
\item{infile}{Character indicating input file (raw from qPCR maching). Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{title}{Character identifying the title of the plot. Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{dilution}{Numeric indicating the diltion of the input as a percentage. e.g. 1:10 = 10 (10%)}

\item{delim}{Character indicating the delimiter in the 'Sample' column to separate conditions (entered first) and replicates (entered second). Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{input}{Character indicating the input condition}

\item{refCond}{Character indicating the control condition to use for normalization. Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{method}{Character indicating analysis method. Currently only percent input method available.}

\item{std}{Numeric indicating standard deviation threshold before evaluating outliers. Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{avg}{Character indicating the averaging method ('geoMean', or 'mean'). Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{writeOut}{Character ("Y"/"N") indicating if results are to be written out to csv. Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{col}{Character indicating the RColorBrewer palette for colour scheme. Default is "Dark2".}

\item{returnDat}{Character ("Y"/"N") indicating if results should be returned to console. Leave NULL to choose interactively.}

\item{showStat}{Boolean indicating if statistics are to be shown. Default is TRUE.}

\item{showEB}{Boolean indicating if error bars are to be showns. Default is TRUE.}
